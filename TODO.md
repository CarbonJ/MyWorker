# MyWorker TODO

**Purpose:** Recored needed fixes, features, etc.  Also record questions about planning or features that not feasible

## Questions - Do not implement, just research and if answered, mark complete
- [ ] Can I query/update the sqlite data base directly? If yes, how?
- [ ] What key shortcuts can be implmented or not? Examples:
    - [ ] <esc> to return to main screen
    - [ ] <CMD + N> to have a quick task entry modal pop up
- [ ] Is it possible to create tasks while browser is not main focus?
    - [ ] Can I call a MacOS shortcut for example to initate something on the browser?  Make a db entry directly?

## Minor - Can implement and mark complete.
- [ ] Add a new file, for a default import. Wood wants three priorities already established and their colors can use the existing configuration as an example.
- [ ] In the Projects screen in the Latest Update column, change how the date is displayed to save screen space.  Put as a MM/DD format (don't need year here since there will be constant updates).
- [ ] In the Data tab of the Setting screen, display curent data usage/amount.

## Major - Do not auto implement. Review, ask about, and determine plans first if.  Mark complete when done.
- [ ] Exported Markdown Report Formatting. Need to give more space
